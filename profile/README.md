## What is Bodypace about

Improve your body "pace". Personalize your medicine. Better your mood, energy, sleep, posture, strength, memory, concentration, endurance, appearance, life expectancy, etc. Generally focus on well-being and thriving while also optimizing money and time/effort costs. Make overwhelming stuff organize and present itself to you in simple precise form while Bodypace automates/hides away unnecessary noise. Provide you with explanations of everything Bodypace recommends or does if it interests you.

For current version go to [bodypace.org](https://bodypace.org).
The end goal looks like this:

One open source platform for gathering your health data, storing it, managing it, sharing it and extracting insights from it.
As much data as possible, as secure as possible, as clear and intuitive as possible and as convenient and automated as possible.

### What we want to handle:
  - `devices/IoT`: smartphones, smart homes, smart watches, smart clothes, smart fridges, kitchen robots, air quality sensors, weighing scales, kitchen scales, computers, light sensors, blood pressure guagues, cameras,...
  - `diet`: water and food intake, calories, macros, microelements, superfoods, diet plans, products, recepies, shops, delivery,...
  - `exercises`: personal plans, stretching, yoga, cardio, sports, runninng, walks, weights lifting, pulse, breathing, posture,...
  - `medications`: drugs, supplements, prescriptions, accessories, guides,...
  - `tests`: blood work, x-rays, tomographies, doctor assesments, dna sequencing, self reported mood, energy levels etc.,...
  - `doctor`: scheduling visits, managing treatments, sharing data with doctors, accessing their treatmans plans,...
  - `AI doctor`: using all data that user provided integrate it with currently known healthcare research and practices to automate away doctors where they are not needed.
  - and more...

### What we want to archive:

For everything mention we want to monitor costs, both money and time/effort, as well as different progress measures.

We should both collect everything that we can about user health and use all the latest medicine knowledge to analyze it.

This should be the place in which you connect all your health information gathering devices and software, where you enter all your health related data, where you control how that data should be stored and with who shared, where you or somobody else or algoritm analyses it.

Focus on prevention and improvement, not only treatment to good enough level.

Do not force a definition of what is optimal/better (above "good enough") to people. Rely on their opinions and only show them different steps along with destinations/results to which they lead. Provide them with informations. Let them pick.

Medicine should not be a pay to win game where common people get basic treatments while rich have personal doctors optimizing them up.

Medicine should not be politically correct, evobiology and evopsychology don't give a fuck about your political views.

Medicine should not be based on human interactions without alternatives as humans are faulty in many ways and our nature is not altruistic in cotrast to a machine, which can fully be.

Create a situation of time working in your favor. No lost time by
wondering around, being unaware of something, fixing some preventable
mistake or going in the wrong way.
