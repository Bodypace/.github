# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to Bodypace

 > disclaimer: this project is a work in progress and not a repleacement of an actual healthcare professional, we recommend visiting one instead of relying on this app.

## What Bodypace is

### Open-source platform for everything health related

  - **Data** (Entered manually or via variuos integrations): **Gathering**, **Storing**, **Managing**, **Sharing**
  - **Assesments** (Extracted from data): **Current health**, **Incomming problems**, **Your potential**, **Relevant progress metrics**
  - **Plans** (Treatments & improvements based on assesments): **Dodging incomming problems**, **Reaching your potential**
  - **Money**, **Time** & **Effort** (Integrated with all above): **Costs**, **Past spending**, **Planning**, **Optimizations**, **Alternatives**

### Our goals

  - Improve your body "pace" & well-being
  - Personalize your medicine
  - Elevate your healthcare target from "good enough" to "thriving"
  - Focus on prevention and improvement in opposition to currently dominating treatment oriented healthcare
  - Better your mood, energy, sleep, posture, strength, memory, concentration, endurance, appearance, life expectancy, etc.
  - Integrate with all the latest medical knowledge and provide it to users in real time
  - Create a situation of time working in your favor. No lost time by wondering around, being unaware of something, fixing some preventable mistake or going in the wrong way.
  - Decrease money, time and effort required to achieve above
  - Make overwhelming stuff organize and present itself to you in simple precise form while Bodypace automates/hides away unnecessary noise
  - Provide you with explanations of everything Bodypace recommends or does if it interests you.
  - Handle as much data as possible in as secure as possible manner inside as clear and intuitive UI as possible with as convenient and automated usage as possible.
  - Lay down the fundaments for future AI Doctor and along with robotics major healthcare automation and costs reduction

### Our believes

 - Medicine should not be a pay to win game where common people get basic treatments while rich have personal doctors optimizing them up.
 - Medicine should not be politically correct, evobiology and evopsychology don't give a fuck about your political views.
 - Medicine should not be based on human interactions without alternatives as humans are faulty in many ways and our nature is not altruistic in cotrast to a machine, which can fully be.
 - Do not force a definition of what is optimal/better (above "good enough") to people. Rely on their opinions and only show them different steps along with destinations/results to which they lead. Provide them with informations. Let them pick.

### What we want to handle

  - `devices/IoT`: smartphones, smart homes, smart watches, smart clothes, smart fridges, kitchen robots, air quality sensors, weighing scales, kitchen scales, computers, light sensors, blood pressure guagues, cameras,...
  - `diet`: water and food intake, calories, macros, microelements, superfoods, diet plans, products, recepies, shops, delivery,...
  - `exercises`: personal plans, stretching, yoga, cardio, sports, runninng, walks, weights lifting, pulse, breathing, posture,...
  - `medications`: drugs, supplements, prescriptions, accessories, guides,...
  - `tests`: blood work, x-rays, tomographies, doctor assesments, dna sequencing, self reported mood, energy levels etc.,...
  - `doctor`: scheduling visits, managing treatments, sharing data with doctors, accessing their treatmans plans,...
  - `AI doctor`: using all data that user provided integrate it with currently known healthcare research and practices to automate away doctors where they are not needed.
  - and more...

## Why open-source?

  - To promote collaboration and integration of various software, hardware and medical solutions in opposition to becoming a yet another one proprietary alternative / competition
  - For inclusivity
  - For transparency
  - For education
